Following up on my previous email, I received a phone call from Trish Braun at Douglas Homes regarding my purchase of 204 Langwell Common SE.  Key issues remain unresolved, particularly Schedule C (Home Warranty) and critical changes to the contract. This post documents the latest interaction and my current position.

### Details:

* **Schedule C:** Trish stated that Schedule C (Home Warranty) is not currently attached and that I'm not entitled to view it until closing. I've firmly stated that I need a copy before proceeding.  I've emphasized my willingness to escalate this concern to their office if they're unable to provide it.
* **Name Change:** Trish confirmed that changing my name on the documents now would be "extra work" and that they will handle this with a future change request (presumably at additional cost). I've clarified that I am not comfortable paying any administrative fees for name changes, but if the Schedule C issue is resolved in writing, I'm willing to proceed with closing.
* **Tub and Ethernet:** I've requested a written confirmation of the tub being a "Larger Side Fill Tub" in Schedule B, and that Ethernet (Cat6e) is clearly incorporated into the laundry room (as a merge of Option 58 with Option 56.) I'm awaiting written confirmation before proceeding.
* **Additional Documentation Requirements:**  In the context of this conversation, I'm emphasizing the need for written confirmation of these changes and the assurance that I will not face further delays or additional costs related to the changes.  This is crucial for my understanding and financial planning, especially regarding a substantial purchase like this.

**Action Items:**

1.  I'm awaiting written confirmation of the Schedule C documentation, the tub type, and the Cat 6e inclusion.  I want this confirmation in writing from Douglas Homes before proceeding with the next steps of closing.
2.  I'll continue to document this transaction in my Jekyll blog, updating the post with any further developments.
3.  I'll be prepared to escalate to higher levels of Douglas Homes if they are unable or unwilling to fulfill these requests.
