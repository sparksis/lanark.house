Trish made many claims about they HOA, roughly to the effect of "the HOA is only responsible ensuring common spaces are maintained".  My understanding of the architectural guidelines is that they persist not-only after the purchase has completed, but the powers are transferred from Melcor to the HOA.  I felt that this over simplification by someone with "decades" of experience was either negligent or lazy.
