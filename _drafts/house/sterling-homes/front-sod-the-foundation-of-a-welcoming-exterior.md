The installation of the front sod is a significant step in completing the exterior of my home and creating a welcoming curb appeal. I am looking forward to seeing the green transformation of the front yard. Currently, I am awaiting the schedule for this installation.

**Next Steps:** I will be requesting the schedule for front sod installation. This will allow me to plan for the final touches on the exterior landscaping.
