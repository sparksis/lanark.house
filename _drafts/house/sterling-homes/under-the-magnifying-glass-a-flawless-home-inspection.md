The home inspection is the moment of truth. It's when a neutral, third-party expert puts the builder's work under a microscope. After my previous experiences, I was bracing for a long list of deficiencies and a battle over repairs. The inspection for 728 Langley Terrace, conducted on May 28, 2025, was, once again, a pleasant surprise.

I hired Marty Keough from Nook & Cranny Home Inspections, a firm with a reputation for thoroughness. Marty spent hours combing through the property, from the foundation to the roof, testing every system and scrutinizing every detail. I followed him through the house, taking notes and asking questions, my anxiety slowly turning to relief.

The final report, a comprehensive PDF titled `728 Langley Terrace _ Nook & Cranny Home Inspections Ltd. _ Marty Keough.pdf`, was a testament to the quality of Sterling's work. The list of deficiencies was remarkably short and consisted of minor, cosmetic issues that were easily addressed. There were no major structural problems, no plumbing or electrical issues, and no signs of shoddy workmanship.

The report was more than just a list of findings; it was a validation. It was objective proof that the quality I had perceived was real. It confirmed that Sterling Homes wasn't just good at sales and paperwork; they were good at building houses.

This was a critical turning point. With a clean inspection report in hand, I had the confidence I needed to move forward to the final stage of the purchase. The house wasn't just a pretty picture; it was a well-built, solid home. The magnifying glass had been applied, and what it revealed was quality.
