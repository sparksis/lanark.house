## Grievances

### Grievance 1 - Integrity

Jayman's [style guide](https://www.jayman.com/assets/Uploads/JAY-2609-Fit-and-Finish-Brochure-CAL_WEB_2025.pdf) states:

> 4-piece ensuites include curbless tiled shower recessed into the floor sloped towards a 32” linear drain. Walls are tiled to ceiling. Includes 80” height, chrome frame, 10 mil glass shower door.

This is not explicitly disclaimed in the purchase agreement, which references the style guide as "the brochure." While the selected home layout (the Avid 20 with a revised ensuite) may not architecturally support a recessed floor, I believe a company that promotes integrity as a core value has an ethical and moral obligation to clearly point out any significant discrepancies between advertising materials and purchase agreements. Jayman insists that upgrading to the 80" height and 10 mil glass promised in the StyleGuide is a nearly $7000 CAD upgrade, which I feel is exploitative. The fact that this upgrade exists demonstrates that at least part of what was advertised is viable with the design's architecture.

### Grievance 2 - Legal Dispute

I feel aggrieved by this exploitative practice and believe I am legally entitled to the 80" 10-millimeter shower design based on Jayman Built's statements in their published brochure, and all other entitlements relating to a 4-piece ensuite.

I believe the contract is ambiguous, and I interpreted it to mean that my "revised ensuite," with a marked 42" by 48" ensuite shower in the 4-piece ensuite, would match the advertised specifications.

I agreed to a $7,820 price increase for the "Revised Ensuite," which revises the ensuite to a 4-piece ensuite (as defined in the purchase agreement), and a $12,600.00 increase to the "Fit and Finish Extra (2)" specification, as advised by the Jayman Sales center and the written, published style guide. I believe I have fulfilled all requirements to be legally entitled to the 4-piece ensuite.

Definition of a 4-piece ensuite:

> Homes with a 4-piece ensuite (separate soaker tub & shower)
>
> (Source: Page 4 of "Jayman BUILT Fit and Finish Extra Specifications 4" Addendum b)

After signing, Jayman Built sales staff stated that the 4-piece ensuite advertised in the style guide is only available on one home model in one location. I feel that the advertisement, which lacks any qualifying language, is materially false and provided as a bad-faith inducement.

I believe I am likely to succeed in civil claims mediation, as the contract is ambiguous (contra proferentem). There is a strong likelihood that a mediator would refer the materially false advertising for review under unfair business practices within the consumer protection act.

### Grievance 3: Lack of Defined Specification

I have received conflicting definitions from Jayman Built representatives regarding the specifications of the ensuite shower they intend to build. The signed agreement documents only explicitly define a 42"x48" shower as being 80" high with 10 mil glass (as referenced in Grievance 1 & 2). Post-signing, via email on April 10th, 2025, the sales associate (Brittney Mack) initially stated the specification would be a 70" height with 5 mil glass. Upon challenge, this was revised via email on April 11th, 2025, to a 75" height with 6 mil glass. [cite: 606, 607, 608, 654, 655, 656]

No specification for either a 70" or 75" shower exists within the signed contract documents (Purchase Agreement, Addendum B, or floor plans). When asked for the contractual basis for the 75" shower specification, the sales associate referenced Addendum B, page 4, point 3: "(other shower stalls applicable to plan)" but failed to point to any specific clause or document defining the dimensions or materials for this 75" shower. This lack of clarity, reliance on a vague catch-all clause, and conflicting information provided post-signing constitutes a significant contractual ambiguity. [cite: 646, 647] As I am now weary of Jayman Built's integrity (or lack thereof), I insist that the final agreed-upon model and full specification be incorporated clearly into the purchase agreement via a formal amendment before proceeding.

### Grievance 4: Delayed Response from Management Causing Interference

Following the inability to resolve the specification dispute with the sales associate, escalation to the Sales Manager, Michael Klassen, was requested via email on April 11th, 2025. The sales associate confirmed the request would be passed on. Despite multiple email follow-ups requesting contact and a timeline (April 16th, April 17th, April 26th), and assurances from the sales associate that contact would be made "today" (April 16th), "soon" (after April 17th), and confirmation that the manager was aware and would reach out (April 26th), no contact was initiated by Mr. Klassen. [cite: 669, 670, 671, 381, 382, 658, 659, 660] It required a direct email from me to Mr. Klassen on April 27th, explicitly stating concern over the good faith nature of the 16+ day delay, to finally elicit a response later that same day. This significant and unexplained delay in addressing a critical contractual ambiguity caused undue stress and interfered with the timely clarification necessary for the potential completion of contract amendments or the initiation of mediation processes.

## Remediations Sought

Based on the grievances outlined above, the following remediations are requested:

1.  **Provision of the 80" Ensuite Shower**: Fulfillment of the contractually implied and advertised 4-piece ensuite shower specifications, specifically:
    * Dimensions: 42" x 48" base.
    * Height: 80" from threshold.
    * Glass: 10 mil clear glass.
    * Frame: Chrome frame at top and sides only.
    * Handle: 8" D handle.
2.  **Formal Documentation**: Inclusion of the exact model number and detailed design specifications for this shower configuration in a formal amendment to the purchase agreement.
3.  **Confirmation of Tankless Water Heater**: Confirmation and documentation within a contract amendment that the home will include the Navien NPE 240A tankless water heater, as specified in the Page 4 of "Jayman BUILT Fit and Finish Extra Specifications 4" Addendum b referenced in the purchase agreement.
4.  **Public Good and Removal of False Advertisements**: Jayman Built takes steps to ensure that marketing materials accurately reflect the products and options available to customers. This includes, but is not limited to:
        * Reviewing all advertising and marketing materials, including online and print media, to identify any discrepancies or misleading information.
        * Removing any false or misleading advertising.
        * Training sales staff to ensure they are accurately representing home specifications to potential buyers.
