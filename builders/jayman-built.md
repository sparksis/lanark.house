My second attempt at purchasing a new home was with Jayman Built, and it served as a stark lesson in the importance of getting every detail in writing. The experience was defined by a dispute over a shower that was prominently featured in their marketing materials but was not included in the contract for our home at 71 Legacy Reach Court SE.

The core of the issue was that a premium, curbless, tiled shower, which we were led to believe was a standard feature, was later presented as a nearly $7,000 upgrade. This felt like a classic "bait and switch." When we tried to get clarity and have the agreed-upon specifications added to the contract, we were met with inconsistent information and long delays.

Communication with the sales team, including Brittney Mack and sales manager Michael Klassen, was frustrating and unproductive. Our attempts to escalate the issue were met with silence, and the dispute was never resolved. In the end, Jayman Built chose to terminate the purchase agreement rather than address our concerns.

This experience highlighted the dangers of relying on verbal agreements and the importance of ensuring that every single detail is clearly and accurately documented in the final contract.

### Key Events of the Experience

*   **Property:** 71 Legacy Reach Court SE
*   **Issues:** The core of this dispute was a contract discrepancy.
    *   The purchase agreement, received around March 4, 2025, did not include the larger, upgraded ensuite shower that had been verbally discussed and agreed upon.
    *   Attempts to resolve this discrepancy and get the desired feature formally added to the contract were unsuccessful, leading to the second collapsed deal.
    *   Meticulous records of this attempt are stored in the “Legacy House (archived)” folder on Google Drive.
