My experience with Sterling Homes was the third and final chapter in my home-buying journey, and it was a story of two distinct halves. While the pre-purchase and sales process was a breath of fresh air, the post-possession phase was not without its significant challenges.

The initial engagement with Sterling Homes was overwhelmingly positive. The sales team was collaborative and client-focused, and the process of securing the mortgage and signing the purchase agreement for my home at 728 Langley Terrace was smooth and transparent. The quality of the construction and the seasonal work, like the driveway and landscaping, was excellent.

However, after taking possession, I encountered a series of frustrations. The site supervisor, Mike, was often dismissive and unprofessional, which made resolving issues more difficult than it needed to be. The mandatory "Virtuo" app, used for communication and service requests, was buggy and unreliable. Furthermore, some customer service was outsourced, which created a sense of disconnect.

Despite these post-possession headaches, the overall experience was largely positive. The warranty process was thorough, the smart home package was a highlight, and the company's efforts to build a community were genuinely appreciated. In the end, while the journey had its bumps, I would recommend Sterling Homes, with the caveat that buyers should be prepared to be persistent and proactive during the warranty and repair phase.
