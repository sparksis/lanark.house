Welcome! I’m Colton English, and this is the story of my journey as a new home builder. You might wonder how this began. To be honest, I’ve wondered the same. With little more than a fascination for architecture and a penchant for fixer-upper TV shows, I stumbled upon the wild and winding world of new home builds, and let me tell you, it has been nothing short of a remarkable journey. For me, buying a house isn't just a financial transaction; it's a 30-year commitment. It's an exchange of a significant portion of my life for a place of comfort, safety, and security. This blog is my way of documenting that journey, the highs and lows, the triumphs and the missteps.

My journey home-building began in earnest a little over a year ago, without a blueprint (pun very much intended). All I knew was that I wanted a space of my own, one that was crafted to my needs, and one that I could look upon, years down the line, as a testament to my perseverance.

In the beginning, my view of home-building was romantic, rosy-cheeked, filled with the delightful prospect of picking out paint colors and kitchen fixtures. However, as I embarked on this path, my rosy vision began to blur, replaced by the gritty reality of managing contracts, budget blowouts, unforeseen delays, and building codes so complex they seemed designed to be confusing.

Yet, I wouldn’t trade this journey for anything. The bumps along the way, as jarring as they were at the time, eventually helped me navigate the new home building terrain with growing confidence. Today, as I sit in my newly built patio, warmed by the morning sun, I see how each hurdle shaped my journey, my understanding of this process, and eventually my home.

In this blog, I will share with you the stages of my journey, exploring themes such as selecting the right builder and managing your budget, through to dealing with delays and ultimately, taking the final walkthrough of your newly built home. All with the intent of equipping you, potential new home buyers and builder researchers, with life-tested tips, learnings, and advice to confidently navigate your home build.

I hope in reading my story you will find solace that you are not alone in this daunting, yet ultimately rewarding undertaking. I hope that with each post, you discover a nugget of wisdom that helps ease your worries or clear your confusion.

While this journey of mine was born out of necessity, constructing a home from scratch has transformed into a labor of love. A labor that has filled me with a profound respect for the craft of home-building and taught me hard-won lessons about patience, resilience, and the delight of watching your dream home take shape, brick by brick.

This blog is my journey home, but I hope it provides a map for your own journey. Together, let’s navigate these uncharted waters of home building. For every storm we weather, every lighthouse we pass, I guarantee, it’s all worth it when we finally drop anchor and call a house, *Home*.

Welcome aboard. I can't wait to share this journey with you.

Sincerely,  
Colton English.
