Hello everyone, it's Colton English. Being a first-time homeowner, I have been fortunate to uncover a lot of revelations down this winding path. The most recent on this trail comes in the form of site supervisor, Mike, a man with exceptional construction knowledge but questionable interpersonal skills. I’ve thought long and hard, and while there are commendable parts, this review of Mike calls for honesty.

When it comes to expertise in the construction domain, Mike aced it. His proficiency was highly palpable. During the project walkthroughs, he would effortlessly manage to find snags and discrepancies, making sure those were ironed out before moving forward. His meticulous attention to detail ensured that I was getting the highest quality services. If there had been a contest for knowing technical blueprints the best, Mike would be nothing short of a champion.

Mike was also, undeniably, a perfect fit as a drinking buddy, scoring high on the likability scale on those pub meets. He had a knack for melting the day's stress away with his well-spun yarns, quirky puns, and interesting anecdotes from his long tenure in the field.

Amidst this warm kinetic energy, however, lay a stark flaw that came as a disheartening revelation and marred the otherwise congenial interaction – Mike, regrettably, dismissed ideas from his subordinates, especially those from women. The particular incident that comes to mind is how he shut down a talented colleague purely because her opinions didn't spar with his.

This woman, an architect of indulgent creativity, proposed ideas that were thoughtful, innovative, and significantly valuable for the project. Being more conservative, Mike preferred traditional approaches, and while there's nothing wrong with that perspective, the problem surfaced when he began unfairly dismissing every suggestion she put forth.

We live in a society where diversity and inclusivity are emphasized, cherished and promoted. It’s not just about the suggestions, but respect for the person giving it. By shutting her down consistently, Mike missed out on legitimate contributions and good rapport with the team, in my view, dimming the sparks of their enthusiasm.

It wasn't a one-time thing, unfortunately. His cavalier attitude towards accepting diverse viewpoints, as if he wore blinkers, hampered smooth project progression. This resulted in dissent in the team and displeasure on my part. When you’re making a 30-year commitment, you expect the people you’re working with to take it as seriously as you do. While Mike’s construction knowledge was impressive, his dismissive attitude and lack of respect for his colleagues and for my concerns was a constant source of frustration. It was a stark reminder that a home is more than just a building; it’s a relationship built on trust and mutual respect.

So, there we have it – Mike. A puzzle of a man that depicted a paradoxical blend of inborn craft and flawed social dynamics. By now you can gauge that a recommendation won't be coming from me, yet that doesn't negate his talent in the construction realm. All I hope is that my review serves its purpose in helping my fellow soon-to-be homeowners in our quest for the perfect home. Choose wisely and best of luck, fellow adventurers!

That's it for today's post. Until the next homeowner adventure, this is Colton signing off.
