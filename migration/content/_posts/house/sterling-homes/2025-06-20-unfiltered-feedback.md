I want to share some unfiltered feedback about my experience with Sterling Homes. I acknowledge upfront that I've had some positive experiences with a few standout members of the Sterling Homes team. However, the overall process has left a bitter enough taste in my mouth that I'm left doubting whether I'd recommend them to potential home buyers.

The journey of home buying should be an exciting time paved with open, respectful communication and teamwork. Unfortunately, my journey with Sterling was hampered by poor interpersonal communication—particularly with an employee named Mike. I found Mike's conduct dismissive and unprofessional, largely ignoring my concerns as valid customer needs and blatantly talking over his colleagues during our interactions. For example, when I raised a concern about the washer and dryer door alignment, rather than acknowledging the issue, Mike dismissed it outright, which made me feel unheard and defensive. He also talked over his colleague Yaz when she pointed out a visible dark spot on the ceiling. Mike’s lack of empathy and disregard for client input made me question my decision to trust Sterling Homes for one of the most significant purchases in my life.

Moving on to Sterling's customer service framework, they use an app called Virtuo for support. As a tech-savvy individual, I understand the importance of a responsive, accommodating tool for customer service. However, Virtuo fell egregiously short in my experience—support inquiries were often ignored, my tickets were left unresolved for extended periods, and the app even displayed a critical UI bug on my Google Pixel phone, where the navigation menu was obscured by Android system buttons, rendering core features unusable. This is particularly frustrating given the Pixel’s significant market share, making this flaw inexcusable.

To add salt to the wound, Sterling outsources their customer service to a third-party agency. I've found that the level of intimacy and comfort you naturally expect from direct communication with the home builder is lost when interactions are facilitated by an impersonal third party. This outsourcing not only disrupted the flow of communication but seriously impacted the overall quality of my home buying experience.

That said, I want to be fair and acknowledge that several other Sterling staff members were transparent and forthcoming throughout the process. Transparency and honesty are core values of mine, and I appreciated those who embodied them. Unfortunately, the negative aspects—especially the dismissive communication style of Mike, the dysfunctional Virtuo app, and the outsourced customer service—seriously overshadowed those positive moments.

In closing, I hope my story serves as a candid wake-up call for Sterling Homes. They have potential and resources, but unless they address these critical gaps in customer service and professionalism, they risk alienating more potential home buyers. For those considering Sterling Homes, I urge you to weigh my experience carefully before making your commitment.
