I want to tell you about my experience with Douglas Homes, a Calgary new home builder, and their salesperson, Trish Braun. It’s a personal story, and it’s a cautionary tale. It’s personal, frustrating, and, frankly, a cautionary tale about what can go wrong when you don’t get the basics right.

**The Beginning: Red Flags I Ignored**

When I first started talking to Douglas Homes, I was excited. The community looked promising, and the homes seemed well-built. But right from the start, I hit a wall: Trish Braun refused to provide a sample contract before I signed anything. That’s a huge red flag for me. How can you commit to something you haven’t even seen? But I pushed forward, hoping it was just a quirk of their process.

**Misrepresentations and Discrepancies**

After signing, I discovered misrepresentations about HOA rules and restrictive covenants that were not disclosed upfront. These aren’t minor details—they affect how you live in your home and what you can do with your property. On top of that, there was an 8-inch discrepancy in the plot plan. Eight inches might sound small, but in real estate, it matters. It’s about trust and accuracy, and I felt both were lacking.

**The Name Game: Bare Minimum Not Met**

Here’s where it got really frustrating. My legal name was wrong on the contract. I’m not talking about a typo in an email—I mean the official contract that binds me to this purchase. I asked repeatedly for this to be corrected. Weeks went by. Emails, calls, and messages were met with delays and excuses. This is the bare minimum a builder should get right. If they can’t handle something as simple as a name correction, what else might they mishandle?

**The Final Straw: A Call That Said It All**

The last call I had with Douglas Homes was the most telling. When I mentioned recording the conversation for my records—something I do to protect myself—they told me I “shouldn’t have any need to record and should trust them.” That dismissive attitude was shocking. Trust is earned, not demanded. And after everything, I had no reason to blindly trust them.

**Why I’m Sharing This**

When you’re trading 30 years of your life for a home, you expect a certain level of respect and professionalism. You expect to feel like a valued partner in the process, not a nuisance. My experience with Douglas Homes, and particularly with Trish Braun, was the complete opposite. It felt like dealing with someone who was simply entitled to my money, without any regard for the significance of the commitment I was making.

**Final Thoughts**

I value precision, honesty, and accountability. These are qualities I expected from my builder but didn’t get. If you want a smooth, trustworthy home buying experience, look elsewhere. Learn from my mistakes so you don’t have to live through the same frustrations.

Stay informed, stay cautious, and good luck on your home buying journey.
