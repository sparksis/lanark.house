My second attempt at buying a new home was with Jayman Built, a well-known Calgary new home builder, and it was a lesson in the importance of getting everything in writing. I was full of excitement and trust, but I was also naive. I made the mistake of relying on verbal assurances, and it's a mistake I hope you can avoid.

This story is about the gap between what was said and what was written. I remember walking into their offices, heart pounding with excitement, my mind filled with all the plans I had for my new home. A friendly representative, with a bright smile and an aura of experience, greeted me and we began the thrilling journey of home-buying. We shared dreams, hopes, and in their words, promises – promises that would soon become the bane of my journey.

The initial steps of my first contract with Jayman Built reflected what I thought was a genuine understanding between us. We discussed the construction plans, land availability, and of course, finances. There was a sense of ease, of forthcoming clarity, that put my wary mind at rest. Their representative reassured me that everything we discussed would make its way into the formal documents in due time and I, excited and trusting, believed her every word.

Don’t get me wrong, I was no fool. I read and re-read every line of the contract they presented me before putting my signature on it. Shockingly though, or perhaps, not so shockingly now in retrospect, I discovered that a handful of the assurances given to me, the "promises" we had discussed didn’t feature in the written contract. Hurried calls were made, explanations were sought, and once again, I was eased into submission by the calming words of the sales representative.

Sure, the missing details were considered trivial, almost insignificant, yet their absence didn't sit right with me. I questioned the builders, and their response was one filled with sighs of patience and painted with the colors of seemingly good intentions. They explained that not all minor details could be cast in the concrete fortress of the contract, but that didn't mean they wouldn’t be honored.

Fast forward a couple of months and reality seemed to match their words. The foundational groundwork was matching our discussions; the house was beginning to resemble the one I had envisioned. However, the niggling feeling of unease never quite left. I decided to approach them for a second contract, a written reassurance that all verbal agreements would be honored.

My second contract with Jayman Built, however, wasn’t met with the same warmth and shared eagerness as the first. Not only did they refuse to put pen to paper on the verbal reassurances, they blamed me for not understanding the “nature” of a contract. The unpleasant encounter left me questioning the decisions I had made, and as you would guess, my house building journey morphed into a never-ending nightmare.

Construction delays, vague excuses, blame games, and escalating costs turned my dream home into a haunting reminder of my costly trust in empty words. The lesson was painful, the emotional toll unbearable, and yet, it served me the hardest truth of house-buying.

I have come through my journey with wisdom, albeit the hard way, and this story is cautionary advice to those embarking on their own paths to buying a new home. Do not lean on verbal agreements. Be proactive, be skeptical, and demand the absolute necessity of a clear, comprehensive, and accurate written contract. Weigh each word, consider every clause, and ensure your builders are contractually bound to deliver what they promise. Always remember, in the world of home ownership, words are fickle, and the only solid ground you have is ink on paper.
