My experience with Jayman Built was a lesson in the importance of the little things. It was a journey that started with excitement and ended in disappointment, and it all came down to a shower. We chose Jayman Built, a well-known builder whose glossy brochures and polished marketing promised quality, integrity, and attention to detail. Among the many features that caught our eye, one stood out—a spacious, luxurious ensuite shower that symbolized a personal sanctuary within our future home at 71 Legacy Reach Court SE.

At first, everything seemed promising. Early conversations with the sales team were positive, and the purchase agreement arrived in March 2025. The ensuite shower was described in their style guide as a curbless, tiled, recessed shower with an 80-inch height, 10-millimeter thick glass, and a sleek chrome frame. This was not just a shower; it was a statement of quality and luxury that we were eager to have in our home.

But when the contract landed on our desk, that promise was nowhere to be found. The ensuite shower specification was vague, and the luxurious details from the brochure were missing. I reached out to Jayman Built to clarify, hoping this was a simple oversight. Instead, it became the first crack in what would turn into a widening chasm of miscommunication and frustration.

Jayman Built insisted that the premium shower described in their brochure was actually an upgrade costing nearly $7,000 CAD. This was shocking because the brochure did not clearly state this, and the purchase agreement ambiguously referenced the brochure as “the brochure” without disclaimers. The model we selected—the Avid 20 with a revised ensuite—did not architecturally support a recessed floor, but the fact that the upgrade existed at all suggested that the advertised shower was at least partially feasible. It felt exploitative, as if the brochure was bait, and the contract was the trap.

As weeks passed, I tried to get the shower specifications formally added to the contract. I exchanged emails and calls with the sales associate, Brittney Mack, who initially said the shower would be 70 inches high with 5-millimeter glass. When I challenged this, the specs shifted to 75 inches and 6-millimeter glass. Yet, none of these specifications were documented in the signed contract or its addenda. The only reference was a vague clause about “other shower stalls applicable to plan,” which was insufficient and unclear. This ambiguity was a glaring red flag.

When I requested escalation to the sales manager, Michael Klassen, the response was maddeningly slow. Despite multiple follow-ups over more than two weeks, I received no direct contact or resolution. It took a direct email expressing concern about the delay before Mr. Klassen finally responded. This delay interfered with any timely resolution and added unnecessary stress to an already difficult situation.

Ultimately, the dispute over the shower was never resolved. In early May, Jayman Built terminated the purchase agreement, ending our dream of a home at Legacy Reach Court. The experience was deeply disappointing but also eye-opening.

This story is not just about a shower. It’s about the importance of transparency, integrity, and communication in the home-building process. Jayman Built’s advertising was misleading, their contract ambiguous, and their communication lacking. The luxury shower that was a symbol of our excitement became a symbol of broken trust.

To anyone considering Jayman Built, I urge you to look beyond the glossy brochures. Ask for clear, written specifications. Demand that every detail important to you is explicitly included in your contract. Watch for vague language and unfulfilled promises. And if you encounter delays or silence when seeking answers, take it as a warning sign.

Building a home is one of the most significant investments you will make—financially and emotionally. It deserves a builder who listens, respects your concerns, and communicates honestly. Our experience with Jayman Built taught us that without these qualities, even the smallest details can become insurmountable obstacles.

May our story serve as a cautionary tale: the devil is truly in the details, and sometimes, it’s the silence that speaks the loudest. Choose your builder wisely. Don’t let your dream home become a story of unmet expectations and lost trust.
