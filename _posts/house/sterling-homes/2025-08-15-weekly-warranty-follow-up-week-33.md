Subject: Urgent Follow-up: Outstanding Warranty Items at 728 Langley Terrace

Dear Sterling Homes Team,

I am writing to follow up on the outstanding warranty items at my home, 728 Langley Terrace. I am becoming increasingly concerned about the lack of progress and communication on these issues.

**Roof Final and Cleaning (In Dispute)**

My concerns about the roof were forwarded to Jaspreet by Deborah Curran from your warranty department. On Friday, July 18, 2025, Empire Roofing visited my home and reported that the damage caused by the painters is extensive and will take more than a single afternoon to fix. They also clarified that cleaning the roof is not part of their scope of work. The required sequence of work is to complete all batten painting, for which the rear of the boards are not painted and are exposed directly to the elements, and then perform the final roof remediation, which includes cleaning all the goop and mismatched paint, and re-puttying and re-sealing all unsealed nails.

I consider this matter to be in dispute, as Jaspreet directly contradicted the warranty report (`158004 - First inspection - 728 Langley Terrace.xlsx`).

**Action Required:**
I need a clear plan and timeline for addressing the damage to the roof, including the cleaning, fixing shingles, re-puttying, and re-sealing of the nails. I also need the specifications for the roofing and eavestrough materials that I have repeatedly requested.

**Eavestrough Repairs**

The eavestrough system has fundamental installation flaws, including incorrect sloping leading to sediment pooling in the south-west eavestrough and a leaking joint. This has been a long-standing issue, and despite my repeated requests for building material specifications to verify proper installation, this information has not been provided. This lack of transparency is concerning. I have expressed my frustration about this in an email on July 11, 2025. While Jaspreet Gill responded on July 29, the issue remains unresolved.

It is not permitted for the downspout from the second-story roof to drain onto the main floor roof in a manner that "seems to saturate the tiles." The primary goal of roof design and water management is to prevent water ingress and maintain the integrity of building components.

**Action Required:**
It seems Sterling is avoiding a simple $30 fix at the risk of a much more expensive roof replacement down the line. I will continue to document the damage and will escalate this to the Alberta New Home Warranty Program as a remediation once it becomes a larger issue. I need an updated schedule for the eavestrough repairs and a confirmation of the proposed solution to fix the drainage issue.

**Fireplace**

There have been some scheduling conflicts on my end, but I am available for the upcoming appointment.

**Action Required:**
If the issue is not remediated with the next appointment, I would like Sterling to provide a full root cause analysis and next steps, as this will be the third attempt to fix the issue.

**Front Sod**

The topsoil has been spread, but there is no grass or seed yet.

**Action Required:**
Please provide a timeline for the sod installation and the municipal grading certificate.

**Ceiling Texture Repair**

The texture repair in the kitchen is scheduled to be completed by next Wednesday. I will be taking photos of the current install quality finish and will be reviewing the completed work against the present work. My only concern is that the patch from earlier in June is glossy, and I would hope to see the same matte finish that is present throughout the rest of the ceiling.

**Drive/Walkway Final Grading**

I am excited to have full use of my garage again. However, the issues noted in the first warranty inspection (`158004 - First inspection - 728 Langley Terrace.xlsx`) were not addressed, and the chips are still present in my garage concrete.

**Action Required:**
Please provide a timeline for pouring the concrete and completing the final grading, and address the chips in the garage concrete.

**Leaning arbor/pergola installed without forewarning**

A leaning arbor/pergola has been installed on my property without my prior knowledge or consent. I would like to understand the purpose of this structure. Jason indicated it might be for new eaves drains, which seems to contradict previous information I received from Jaspreet regarding the south-east drainage.

I have not received any documentation about this structure and consider it an unauthorized modification to my property. If this is a requirement from the HOA, I request a complete specification of the requirements.

I expect to be consulted on all work before it is executed on my property. This includes any decision regarding the removal of this structure, which I would like to discuss after you have provided the requested documentation.

I expect a response with a clear plan of action and estimated timelines for each of these items by the end of day, August 18, 2025. Your prompt attention and cooperation in resolving these matters is greatly appreciated.

Best regards,

Colton English

728 Langley Terrace
